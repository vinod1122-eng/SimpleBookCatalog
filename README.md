# SimpleBookCatalog

Hey there, if you're just starting out with Blazor and Entity Framework Core, I've got a project you might like! It's called "Blazor CRUD Jumpstart with Entity Framework Core in .NET 8."

In this project, we're going to build a simple app for keeping track of books. You'll learn how to add new books, list all the books you have, update details of existing books, and even delete books if you want.

This project is perfect for those who already know a bit about Blazor and Entity Framework Core. I'll show you how to do all these things using these frameworks in .NET 8.

To join in, you'll need to have .NET 8 and Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition installed on your computer. By the end of the project, you'll understand how to:

1. Navigate around your app better and handle forms more effectively.
2. Make your app perform better by rendering things smoothly as you go.
3. Plus, you'll learn to make a form that you can use over and over again for adding and updating book details.
4. And finally, we'll explain you how to make parts of your app update dynamically without reloading the whole page, which is really cool!

So, if you're ready to dive in and learn all these cool things, this course is for you!
